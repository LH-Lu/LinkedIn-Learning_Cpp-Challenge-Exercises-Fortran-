! Ex2: Sorting Arrays
! As an exercise, implement a simple sorting algorithm (not the one done in C++ version) to sort an array in ascending order only
    
    PROGRAM Ex2_SortArray
    
        implicit none
        
        character :: EndChar
        
        
        print *, "Hello world"
        
        read (*, '(A)') EndChar
        
    END PROGRAM Ex2_SortArray
